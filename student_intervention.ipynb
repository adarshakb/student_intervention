In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Three supervised learning models that are appropriate for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees\n",
    "    - Real-world application: Researching about this topic i found many real world applications. The most interesting was how it was applied in Astronomy where it was used to classify star galactic formations from the data sent by probes. I would imagine that there are many types of variables in classifying a Star or Galaxy based on many different attributes, and a trained classifier can label them with good accuracy as there are billions of star out there and its difficult to classify manually.\n",
    "    - Strengths\n",
    "        - Expressiveness of DT - After forming a good model, if we look (i.e in the form of graphs) at decision trees, we can gain deeper insights into the problem.\n",
    "        - Maximizes information gain. - Decision trees always maximizes information gain and shortest trees. Thus it self corrects itself to have less overfitting.\n",
    "        - They can get highly accurate in classification especially when there are binary variables involved.\n",
    "    - Weaknesses\n",
    "        - ID3 Bias. Restriction biases. We only consider those functions which are represented by a decision tree. This means that it only tries to maximize information gain and other types of functions are left out (like differential functions)\n",
    "        - Overfitting - A decision tree with large number of levels is prone to overfit and gets complicated. As the depth increases, the complexity grows exponentially. We should be careful to avoid overfitting of train set and prune the tree at the correct location.\n",
    "    - Why is this a good model for the problem: \n",
    "        - This is a good model because there are over 30 features in the input data, and all of them might not be useful. Decision trees automatically select the features with the highest information gain the begining and thus filter out lot of unnecessary noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- K-Nearest Neighbors  (GaussianNB)\n",
    "    - Real-world application: It has been used in ecnomic forcasting to predict how well a product might fit into a given geographical area. It is also used in housing prices prediction and classification of neighbourhoods.\n",
    "    - Strengths\n",
    "        - It is easy to understand model with many ways to tune it (the distance function, weights, depth, K val etc)\n",
    "        - It is good if training data is large. \n",
    "        It is robust in noisy data if we tune the distance function to be inverse square of weighted distances\n",
    "    - Weaknesses\n",
    "        - Need to determine the value of k. It can be anything\n",
    "        - Need to define the TYPE of distance. Not all problems can have a \"distance\" between them\n",
    "        - High computation cost to determine the distance on each query on multiple training samples.\n",
    "    - Why is this a good model for the problem:\n",
    "        - This algorithm may work well in our case because if a students share many of the attributes (i.e distance between them is low), then there is higher chance they are similar. i.e if many students who have been underperforming in test scores fail, a new student who underperforms in test score will need attention in real world as the student has more chance of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensamble: Gradient Boosting\n",
    "    - Real-world application: Ensable methods in gradient boosing's idea is used in many places and other algorithms too like random forest. One application is spam classification of emails. The classifier is used along with other models. The advantage of this classifier is that it does not overfit the data too much and thus it is hard for someone who is trying to hack a spam classifier to control predictions.\n",
    "    - Strengths\n",
    "        - Falls into the ensamble class forming weak classifies (always better than chance prediction p >0.5)\n",
    "        - This method works really well as it picks out outliers and learns from them\n",
    "        - This is effective because the error rate of training and test sets seems to always decrease!\n",
    "        - larger margins are produced which means that in further iterations the confidence in prediction increases.\n",
    "    - Weaknesses\n",
    "        - This is a slow algorithm. especially when going through multiple iterations producing many weaklearners. \n",
    "    - Why is this a good model for the problem: \n",
    "        - This is an ensable methods where with more data and training the prediction is seen to improve more. Thus using this will give a good userstanding to us"

    "~~Ensable learners use the concept of \"weak learners\" where in the simple rule is to find a prediction at each stage which has a accuracy better than chance i.e p > 0.5. This is very simple concept but when it is iterated over several of the parameters it produces a powerful classifier. In the training stage we take known data with known labels and produce a hypothesis which gives us p>0.5, then we repeat it for several iteration. Then finally we combine the models  individually according to thier weights and produce a final model.~~\n",
